== Welcome to Stretchpants!

Stretchpants is a really basic rails app that stores its data in elasticsearch.
Normally one would store data in a database or key-value store and then add
elastic search to it, but as this app shows it's entirely possible to store the
data directly in elastic search.

== Getting Started

1. bundle install
2. start elasticsearch
3. ELASTICSEARCH_URL="http://localhost:9200" bundle exec rails s
4. point your favourite browser to http://localhost:3000
